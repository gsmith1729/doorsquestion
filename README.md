The Millennium school has 1000 students and 1000 student lockers. The lockers are in a line in a long corridor and are numbered from 1 to 1000. Initially all the lockers are closed (but unlocked). The rst student walks along the corridor and opens every locker. The second student then walks along the corridor and closes every second locker, i.e. closes lockers 2, 4, 6, etc. At that point there are 500 lockers that are open and 500 that are closed. The third student then walks along the corridor, changing the state of every third locker. Thus s/he closes locker 3 (which had been left open by the rst student), opens locker 6 (closed by the second student), closes locker 9, etc. MAT 2008
